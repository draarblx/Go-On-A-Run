# Go-On-A-Run
Go On A Run is a fastpaced mario party styled game created in Lua using Love2d.
This game was made for my technology assignment. This was a much better and playable version to my previous game 'Go On A Jog' which I had made for a gamejam.

While some of the visuals aren't mine, the core design, logic, and gameplay were all made by me.
